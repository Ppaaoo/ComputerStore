# ComputerStore

This app is a simulation of a computer store in which you can see your imaginary bank account, work, and buy a laptop from the computer store.
Some restrictions in the app are:
- Not able to loan more than double your balance in your bank account
- Can only buy laptops that are in stock.
- Can only buy laptops if you have sufficient funds in your bank account.
- Can only take a single loan that needs to be payed back in full to take a new loan.
- Working gives you 100 SEK that you can then bank to your bank balance
- If you have a loan when banking, the loan will be payed by 10% of the banked amount and the remaining money will be transferred to your bank balance.

The app is hosted with GitHub Pages and can be found here: https://ppaaoo.github.io/
